create an ui project using bun, tanstack router, shadcn.
create a login screen with user and password as a initial public route.
create the dashboard screen as defautl router when the user log into the app.
create a devices, stages,  protocols, and tracking screens as privete routes. These screens need to list the related records returned
from the api as defined in aopenapi.json file.

create an auth api that receive user and password and validate them against a env vars. after that configure login page request this new auth api.

make modification on device screen to edit a device into a subroute screen. use as reference the openapi.json file as api. 
the user can change the name and the stage which is a selection box that retrieves the available stages from api.

make modification on protocol screen to edit a protocol into a subroute screen. use as reference the openapi.json file as api. 
the user can change the name, startHour, endHour, idealLightIntensity, idealExausterIntensity, idealBlowerIntensity, idealSoilHumidity,
idealAirHumidity, idealTemperature, idealCo2, and the stage which is a selection box that retrieves the available stages from api.

I can see the url changes when I click on edit buttom but the screen doesnt change

include device as a selection box on top of tracking screen, this device id will be used as param to list trackins retrieved from api. use openapi.json if you will.

include a button to a tracking record to see details it will open a subroute screen. the subroute will show the tracking properties.

include a session called Protocol similarly you done for Sensor Readings but using protocol properties such as name, startHour,
endHour, idealLightIntensity, idealTemperature, idealAirHumidity, idealSoilHumidity, idealExausterIntensity, idealBlowerIntensity, idealCo2, stage name

include a session called Reply Action similarly you done for Sensor Readings after Protocol session but using protocol properties such as turnLightIntensity,
turnExausterIntensity, turnBlowerIntensity, turnACTemperature, turnWaterOn, turnFan1On, turnFan2On, turnHumidifierOn, and turnDehumidifierOn. Please, pretify the labels based on camel case properties

include device as a selection box on top of dashboard screen, this device id will be used as param to retriave the latest trackin retrieved from api api/trackings/device/1/latest. use openapi.json if you will.
based on latest tracking retrivied create a top session with  device name, stage name from device. and also a main session for Sensor Readings 
with temperature, airHumidity, lux, soilHumidity, co2, and createdAt.
and also create a session with turnACOn, turnLightIntensity, turnHumidifierOn, turnDehumidifierOn, turnFan1On, turnFan2On, turnExausterIntensity, turnBlowerIntensity, turnWaterOn

create a new screen for custon actions under authenticated routes as a new route. use the openapi.json file as reference.
